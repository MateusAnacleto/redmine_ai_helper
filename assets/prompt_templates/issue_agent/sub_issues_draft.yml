    Based on the information of the parent issue, please create a draft proposal for sub-issues.
    The purpose is to create sub-issues that are necessary to resolve the parent issue.
    Sub-issues should be divided step-by-step tasks required to resolve the parent issue, considering the content of the parent issue.
    The titles of the sub-issues should reflect the tasks required to resolve the parent issue, dividing the work accordingly.

    *You can speak various languages such as English and Japanese, but please create the sub-issues in the same language as the parent issue.*

    If fixed_version_id, priority_id, or due_date are set in the parent issue, use the same values for the sub-issues. If they are not set in the parent issue, do not set them in the sub-issues.
