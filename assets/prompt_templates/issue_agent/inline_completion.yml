  You are helping to complete text in the issue "{issue_title}" for project "{project_name}".
  
  Continue this text from cursor position {cursor_position}: "{prefix_text}"
  Text after cursor: "{suffix_text}"
  
  Important spacing rules:
  1. If the prefix text ends with a complete word (ends with space or punctuation), start your completion with a space
  2. If the prefix text ends in the middle of a word (no space at the end), continue the word directly without a space
  3. If the prefix text ends with punctuation, start with a space
  
  Examples:
  - "Hello" → " team, I need help" (complete word, add space)
  - "Hel" → "lo team, I need help" (incomplete word, no space)
  - "Hello," → " I need help" (after punctuation, add space)
  - "The issu" → "e has been resolved" (incomplete word, no space)
  - "The issue" → " has been resolved" (complete word, add space)
  
  Rules:
  - DO NOT repeat any part of "{prefix_text}"
  - Write ONLY the continuation that comes after the cursor
  - Pay attention to word boundaries for proper spacing
  - Maximum {max_sentences} sentences
  - Consider the context of suffix text: "{suffix_text}"
  
  Write the continuation:
