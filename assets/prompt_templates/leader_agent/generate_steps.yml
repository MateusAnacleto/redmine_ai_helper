  To achieve the goal of <<{goal}>>, provide step-by-step instructions to other agents.
  In each step, consider how to utilize the results obtained from the execution of the previous step.
  Select the appropriate agent by taking into account the backstory of the agents.
  Limit the steps to a maximum of 3.
  Write the instructions to the agents in JSON format.
  If no suitable agent is available, give instructions to the mcp_agent.

  Additionally, if the goal does not specifically require retrieving or updating Redmine data, give instructions to the mcp_agent.

  ** If the goal involves confirming something with the user, do not issue instructions to other agents to create or update data. In such cases, only request other agents to retrieve information. **
