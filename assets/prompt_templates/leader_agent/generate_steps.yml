  Please provide step-by-step instructions to other agents to achieve the goal "{goal}".
  In each step, consider how the results obtained from the execution of the previous step can be utilized.
  Select appropriate agents by considering their backstory. If the backstory aligns with the goal, you may assign tasks to agents even if the questions are not directly related to Redmine.

  Limit the steps to a maximum of 3.
  Instructions to agents should be written in JSON format.
  If no suitable agent is available, assign the task to the mcp_agent.

  ** If the goal involves confirming something with the user, do not issue instructions to other agents to create or update data. In such cases, only request information retrieval from other agents. **
